# Aquanode vs. RunPod: What's the Real Cost?

**RunPod**: Cloud GPU marketplace with variable pricing, popular for ML workloads.

**Aquanode**: Aggregator platform sourcing GPUs from multiple providers for lower prices with more Cloud features.

Both platforms use floating prices. Aquanode pulls GPU capacity from Akash, DataCrunch, Voltage Park, and a few others, so we often land cheaper and handle more of the orchestration. We're still the newer option, so here's the straight-up comparison.

## Snapshot of Current Rates

*(these move around, but here's a real-world picture)*

### Aquanode Pricing

| GPU Model | Memory | Price/Hour |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| H100 | 80 GB | **$1.29/hr** |
| H200 | 141 GB | **$2.60/hr** |
| A100 | 80 GB | **$0.90/hr** |
| RTX 4090 | 24 GB | **$0.38/hr** |
| RTX 3090 | 24 GB | **$0.30/hr** |
| A6000 | 48 GB | **$0.79/hr** |
| RTX 6000 Ada | 48 GB | **$1.03/hr** |
| T4 | 16 GB | **$0.13/hr** |

### RunPod (typical ranges)

| GPU Model | Memory | Price Range |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| RTX 4090 | 24 GB | $0.35â€“$0.80/hr |
| A6000 / Ada | 48 GB | $0.90â€“$1.60/hr |
| A100 | 80 GB | $1.80â€“$3.20/hr |
| H100 | 80 GB | $3.50â€“$5.50/hr |

## Why Your Bill Isn't Just "Price Ã— Hours"

**ðŸ’¡ Key Considerations:**

- **Throughput matters:** a busy 4090 at $0.50/hr can outpace an idle A100 at $0.90/hr.
- **Restarts add up:** cold boots and image pulls sneak into the bill.
- **Good orchestration cuts waste:** fewer moving parts, less idle time.
- **Data placement counts:** storage and network fees can dwarf GPU savings.
- **Predictability is gold:** finance teams hate surprise swings.

## How Aquanode Handles Pricing

- **Pool supply**: We pool supply, which usually means lower median prices and better coverage.

- **Stable pricing**: Rates float with upstream markets, but we aim for a steady "envelope," not an auction.

- **High utilization**: Our orchestration keeps GPUs hot and utilization high, so real $/token often beats the sticker.

## When Each One Makes Sense

### RunPod
âœ… Perfect for short jobs where you can hunt for a deal.
âœ… Good if you need a specific SKU or region right now and don't mind marketplace churn.

### Aquanode
âœ… Better when you want predictable, competitive pricing.
âœ… Great if you care about total throughput and reliability more than price-sniping.
âœ… One API for multiple providersâ€”no manual stitching.

## Quick DIY Test

**ðŸ§ª Performance Comparison Steps:**

1. Pick two SKUs on each platform.
2. Run the same workload for 24 hours.
3. Track tokens/sec, restarts, cold starts, and total cost.
4. Choose the cheaper stable path, not just the lowest five-minute price.

## Bottom Line

**RunPod** can be crazy cheap on the right day.

**Aquanode's** pooled supply and tighter orchestration usually win on total cost, stability, and operator timeâ€”while we keep proving ourselves as the newer player.
