# Aquanode vs Shadeform: What's the Real Difference for GPU Buyers in 2025?

**TLDR**  
- Shadeform aggregates GPU listings.  
- Aquanode is a full GPU platform with software that lets you deploy, move, monitor and manage workloads across multiple providers.  
- The biggest difference: Shadeform shows you where GPUs are; Aquanode helps you actually run production workloads reliably across them.  
- Aquanode includes workload mobility, GPU-level monitoring, cost alerts, pause/resume and one-click switching between providers.  
- For teams that need more than price comparison, Aquanode is the more complete operational layer.

## Why the comparison matters

GPU marketplaces are evolving fast. A year ago, most platforms were simple aggregators. They showed a list of providers, some pricing tables and a few specs. That was useful, but not enough for teams running real training pipelines or inference services.

Today, developers want more:

- Multi-cloud flexibility  
- Real workload mobility  
- Unified monitoring  
- Alerts to avoid runaway spending  
- Tools to debug or resume jobs  
- A stable interface across providers  

Shadeform and Aquanode both target this space, but they approach it in very different ways.

---

## Shadeform: A straightforward GPU aggregator

Shadeform's core value is simplicity.

It aggregates GPU prices and availability from various cloud and bare-metal providers, so you can compare what's out there. For teams that just want a directory of GPU options, it's a clean way to see who has capacity.

Shadeform is useful if your workflow looks like this:

- You compare GPU prices and availability  
- You deploy or schedule a GPU.
- You manage everything else yourself: data backups, cloud storage adapters, and monitoring.

Shadeform does not operate as a workload platform. It does not provide its own deployment layer, monitoring tools or workload migration capabilities. It's essentially a discovery and comparison tool.

---

## Aquanode: A multi-cloud GPU platform, not just an aggregator

Aquanode started as a marketplace but evolved into a full GPU runtime layer. Instead of only showing you GPU options, Aquanode gives you the software you need to run, monitor and move workloads across providers.

The difference becomes clear once you go beyond price comparison.

Aquanode includes:

- One-click deployments across multiple providers  
- The ability to move workloads between GPUs without redoing your setup  
- Real-time monitoring for each GPU session  
- Alerts for cost spikes, idle GPUs or paused sessions  
- A consistent interface no matter which cloud you use  
- Pause and resume capabilities to save money  
- Centralized billing for all accounts  

This makes Aquanode behave like a control plane for GPU compute, not just a listing service.

## The biggest difference: Workload mobility

Shadeform helps you find GPUs.  
Aquanode helps you use GPUs across clouds as if they were one system.

With Aquanode, you can:

- Launch on one provider  
- Pause the workload  
- Resume it on another provider  
- Keep the same environment and data configuration  
- Automatically route storage adapters  
- Avoid vendor lock-in  

This lets teams chase the best price, lowest latency, or fastest runtime without starting from scratch.

For production AI systems, workload mobility is one of the highest-impact cost levers.

---

## Monitoring and alerts: Another major gap

Shadeform doesn't provide operational tooling. Once you leave their site, you manage everything manually on the provider's dashboard.

Aquanode, on the other hand, includes:

- GPU health monitoring  
- Usage graphs  
- Network and storage activity  
- Coming Soon: Custom alerts (budget, time, idle detection)

This is crucial when running training jobs that might run for days or inference workloads with dynamic traffic.

Without monitoring:

- Idle GPUs burn money  
- Training failures go unnoticed
- You risk scaling too late or too early  
- Cost spikes become unpredictable  

Aquanode solves these issues with built-in oversight.

---

## Who is Shadeform best for?

Shadeform works well for:

- Users who only want a price list  
- People comfortable managing deployments manually  
- Hobbyists or small projects  
- Teams that don't need mobility, monitoring or alerts  

If all you want is GPU availability data, Shadeform does the job.

---

## Who is Aquanode best for?

Aquanode is built for teams that want:

- Production-grade deployments  
- Multi-cloud flexibility  
- A consistent GPU runtime environment  
- Tools to prevent cost overruns  
- The ability to move workloads between providers  
- Better reliability and diagnostics  

For most engineering teams, Aquanode offers a more complete solution.

## Final Verdict

**Shadeform** is an GPU aggregator.  
**Aquanode** is a multi-cloud GPU platform built to actually run your workloads.

Shadeform helps you compare.  
Aquanode helps you compare, monitor and migrate workloads across providers.

If your needs end at discovering GPU prices, Shadeform is enough.  
If you're running training, fine-tuning or inference in a multi-cloud world, Aquanode gives you the software layer that makes it manageable.
