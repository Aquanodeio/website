    "excerpt": "Both float. Aquanode aggregates Akash/DataCrunch/Voltage Park, tends cheaper with more orchestration. Here’s when each wins.",
    "content": "Short version: both prices float. Aquanode aggregates capacity from Akash, DataCrunch, Voltage Park, and others—so we usually land cheaper and wrap more orchestration—but we’re newer. Here’s the honest breakdown.\n\nAquanode today — posted examples (subject to change):\n• H100 80GB (SXM5): $1.29/hr\n• H200 141GB (SXM5): $2.60/hr\n• A100 80GB (SXM4): $0.90/hr\n• RTX 4090 24GB (PCIe): $0.38/hr\n• RTX 3090 24GB (PCIe): $0.30/hr\n• A6000 48GB (PCIe): $0.79/hr\n• RTX 6000 Ada 48GB (PCIe): $1.03/hr\n• T4 16GB (PCIe): $0.13/hr\n\nRunPod today — typical ranges (they change):\n• 4090 24GB: ~$0.35–$0.80/hr depending on host, region, queue, and demand\n• A6000/A6000 Ada 48GB: ~$0.90–$1.60/hr\n• A100 80GB: ~$1.80–$3.20/hr\n• H100 80GB: ~$3.50–$5.50/hr\n\nWhy your bill differs from the sticker:\n• Throughput > sticker: a well-fed 4090 at $0.50/hr can beat an idle A100 at $0.90/hr.\n• Churn tax: restarts, cold boots, and image pulls quietly add cost.\n• Orchestration matters: hot pipelines and fewer moving parts reduce waste.\n• Data gravity: storage, egress/ingress, and dataset placement can dwarf GPU deltas.\n• Predictability: finance teams prefer a tight cost envelope over lottery pricing.\n\nAquanode pricing reality (we float too):\n• Aggregated supply means lower median prices and better coverage, but rare SKUs can spike.\n• We update posted rates as upstream capacity shifts; the goal is a predictable envelope, not auctions.\n• Our orchestration keeps GPUs hot and utilization high, which often lowers effective $/token vs sticker.\n\nPick RunPod when:\n• You’re price‑sniping short bursts and can tolerate marketplace churn.\n• You need a very specific SKU/region right now and you’re tooling-heavy.\n\nPick Aquanode when:\n• You want a steady pricing envelope with competitive floors.\n• You care about aggregate throughput, reliability, and fewer operational knobs.\n• You want one API/surface that spans multiple providers without you stitching them.\n\nA one‑day decision plan:\n• Pick two candidate SKUs per provider.\n• Run the same workload for 24h (same image, batch size, dataset).\n• Log tokens/sec, restarts, cold starts, and total cost.\n• Choose the cheaper stable path—not the lowest five‑minute price.\n\nBottom line:\nRunPod’s marketplace can be rock‑bottom on a lucky day. Aquanode’s aggregated supply and orchestration typically win on total cost, stability, and operator time—while we keep improving trust and track record as the newer option.\n\nNote:\nRanges are approximate and shift with supply/demand and host quality. Aquanode examples are from our public pricing at the time of writing and may change.",
