    Got it—you want something that feels more like a human-written blog post. Here’s a tighter, more conversational draft you can drop straight into a post:

Aquanode vs. RunPod — What’s the Real Cost?

Both platforms use floating prices. Aquanode pulls GPU capacity from Akash, DataCrunch, Voltage Park, and a few others, so we often land cheaper and handle more of the orchestration. We’re still the newer option, so here’s the straight-up comparison.

Snapshot of Current Rates

(these move around, but here’s a real-world picture)

Aquanode

H100 80 GB: $1.29/hr

H200 141 GB: $2.60/hr

A100 80 GB: $0.90/hr

4090 24 GB: $0.38/hr

3090 24 GB: $0.30/hr

A6000 48 GB: $0.79/hr

RTX 6000 Ada 48 GB: $1.03/hr

T4 16 GB: $0.13/hr

RunPod (typical ranges)

4090 24 GB: $0.35–$0.80/hr

A6000 / Ada 48 GB: $0.90–$1.60/hr

A100 80 GB: $1.80–$3.20/hr

H100 80 GB: $3.50–$5.50/hr

Why Your Bill Isn’t Just “Price × Hours”

Throughput matters: a busy 4090 at $0.50/hr can outpace an idle A100 at $0.90/hr.

Restarts add up: cold boots and image pulls sneak into the bill.

Good orchestration cuts waste: fewer moving parts, less idle time.

Data placement counts: storage and network fees can dwarf GPU savings.

Predictability is gold: finance teams hate surprise swings.

How Aquanode Handles Pricing

We pool supply, which usually means lower median prices and better coverage.

Rates float with upstream markets, but we aim for a steady “envelope,” not an auction.

Our orchestration keeps GPUs hot and utilization high, so real $/token often beats the sticker.

When Each One Makes Sense

RunPod

Perfect for short jobs where you can hunt for a deal.

Good if you need a specific SKU or region right now and don’t mind marketplace churn.

Aquanode

Better when you want predictable, competitive pricing.

Great if you care about total throughput and reliability more than price-sniping.

One API for multiple providers—no manual stitching.

Quick DIY Test

Pick two SKUs on each platform.

Run the same workload for 24 hours.

Track tokens/sec, restarts, cold starts, and total cost.

Choose the cheaper stable path, not just the lowest five-minute price.

Bottom line: RunPod can be crazy cheap on the right day.
Aquanode’s pooled supply and tighter orchestration usually win on total cost, stability, and operator time—while we keep proving ourselves as the newer player.
