Performance
Audits that have impact on the performance of your site

Total Blocking Time
Sum of all time periods between FCP and Time to Interactive, when task length exceeded 50ms, expressed in milliseconds. Learn more about the Total Blocking Time metric

Document request latency
Your first network request is the most important. Reduce its latency by avoiding redirects, ensuring a fast server response, and enabling text compression

Improve image delivery
Reducing the download time of images can improve the perceived load time of the page and LCP. Learn more about optimizing image size

LCP request discovery
Optimize LCP by making the LCP image discoverable from the HTML immediately, and avoiding lazy-loading

Legacy JavaScript
Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. Consider modifying your JavaScript build process to not transpile Baseline features, unless you know you must support legacy browsers. Learn why most sites can deploy ES6+ code without transpiling

Render blocking requests
Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. Deferring or inlining can move these network requests out of the critical path

Time to Interactive
Time to Interactive is the amount of time it takes for the page to become fully interactive. Learn more about the Time to Interactive metric

Max Potential First Input Delay
The maximum potential First Input Delay that your users could experience is the duration of the longest task. Learn more about the Maximum Potential First Input Delay metric

Reduce unused JavaScript
Reduce unused JavaScript and defer loading scripts until they are required to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. Learn how to reduce unused JavaScript

Avoid multiple page redirects
Redirects introduce additional delays before the page can be loaded. Learn how to avoid page redirects

Avoid serving legacy JavaScript to modern browsers
Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. Consider modifying your JavaScript build process to not transpile Baseline features, unless you know you must support legacy browsers. Learn why most sites can deploy ES6+ code without transpiling

Reduce JavaScript execution time
Consider reducing the time spent parsing, compiling, and executing JS. You may find delivering smaller JS payloads helps with this. Learn how to reduce Javascript execution time

Minimize main-thread work
Consider reducing the time spent parsing, compiling and executing JS. You may find delivering smaller JS payloads helps with this. Learn how to minimize main-thread work

Largest Contentful Paint element
This is the largest contentful element painted within the viewport. Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint element

Largest Contentful Paint image was lazily loaded
Above-the-fold images that are lazily loaded render later in the page lifecycle, which can delay the largest contentful paint. Learn more about optimal lazy loading

First Contentful Paint
First Contentful Paint marks the time at which the first text or image is painted. Learn more about the First Contentful Paint metric

Largest Contentful Paint
Largest Contentful Paint marks the time at which the largest text or image is painted. Learn more about the Largest Contentful Paint metric

Cumulative Layout Shift
Cumulative Layout Shift measures the movement of visible elements within the viewport. Learn more about the Cumulative Layout Shift metric

Speed Index
Speed Index shows how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated. Learn more about the Speed Index metric

Layout shift culprits
Layout shifts occur when elements move absent any user interaction. Investigate the causes of layout shifts, such as elements being added, removed, or their fonts changing as the page loads

Optimize DOM size
A large DOM can increase the duration of style calculations and layout reflows, impacting page responsiveness. A large DOM will also increase memory usage. Learn how to avoid an excessive DOM size

Forced reflow
Many APIs, typically reading layout geometry, force the rendering engine to pause script execution in order to calculate the style and layout. Learn more about forced reflow and its mitigations

Network dependency tree
Avoid chaining critical requests by reducing the length of chains, reducing the download size of resources, or deferring the download of unnecessary resources to improve page load

Optimize viewport for mobile
Tap interactions may be delayed by up to 300 ms if the viewport is not optimized for mobile

Eliminate render-blocking resources
Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. Learn how to eliminate render-blocking resources

Properly size images
Serve images that are appropriately-sized to save cellular data and improve load time. Learn how to size images

Defer offscreen images
Consider lazy-loading offscreen and hidden images after all critical resources have finished loading to lower time to interactive. Learn how to defer offscreen images

Minify CSS
Minifying CSS files can reduce network payload sizes. Learn how to minify CSS

Minify JavaScript
Minifying JavaScript files can reduce payload sizes and script parse time. Learn how to minify JavaScript

Reduce unused CSS
Reduce unused rules from stylesheets and defer CSS not used for above-the-fold content to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. Learn how to reduce unused CSS

Efficiently encode images
Optimized images load faster and consume less cellular data. Learn how to efficiently encode images

Serve images in next-gen formats
Image formats like WebP and AVIF often provide better compression than PNG or JPEG, which means faster downloads and less data consumption. Learn more about modern image formats

Enable text compression
Text-based resources should be served with compression (gzip, deflate or brotli) to minimize total network bytes. Learn more about text compression

Preconnect to required origins
Consider adding preconnect or dns-prefetch resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins. Learn how to preconnect to required origins

Initial server response time was short
Keep the server response time for the main document short because all other requests depend on it. Learn more about the Time to First Byte metric

Use video formats for animated content
Large GIFs are inefficient for delivering animated content. Consider using MPEG4/WebM videos for animations and PNG/WebP for static images instead of GIF to save network bytes. Learn more about efficient video formats

Remove duplicate modules in JavaScript bundles
Remove large, duplicate JavaScript modules from bundles to reduce unnecessary bytes consumed by network activity.

Preload Largest Contentful Paint image
If the LCP element is dynamically added to the page, you should preload the image in order to improve LCP. Learn more about preloading LCP elements

Avoids enormous network payloads
Large network payloads cost users real money and are highly correlated with long load times. Learn how to reduce payload sizes

Uses efficient cache policy on static assets
A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. Learn more about efficient cache policies

Avoids an excessive DOM size
A large DOM will increase memory usage, cause longer style calculations, and produce costly layout reflows. Learn how to avoid an excessive DOM size

All text remains visible during webfont loads
Leverage the font-display CSS feature to ensure text is user-visible while webfonts are loading. Learn more about
font-display

Does not use passive listeners to improve scrolling performance
Consider marking your touch and wheel event listeners as passive to improve your page's scroll performance. Learn more about adopting passive event listeners

Avoids document.write()
For users on slow connections, external scripts dynamically injected via document.write() can delay page load by tens of seconds. Learn how to avoid document.write()

Image elements have explicit width and height
Set an explicit width and height on image elements to reduce layout shifts and improve CLS. Learn how to set image dimensions

Has a <meta name="viewport"> tag with width or initial-scale
A <meta name="viewport"> not only optimizes your app for mobile screen sizes, but also prevents a 300 millisecond delay to user input. Learn more about using the viewport meta tag

Accessibility
Opportunities to improve the accessibility for your visitors

Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast

[aria-*] attributes match their roles
Each ARIA role supports a specific subset of aria-_ attributes. Mismatching these invalidates the aria-_ attributes. Learn how to match ARIA attributes to their roles

Uses ARIA roles only on compatible elements
Many HTML elements can only be assigned certain ARIA roles. Using ARIA roles where they are not allowed can interfere with the accessibility of the web page. Learn more about ARIA roles

ARIA attributes are used as specified for the element's role
Some ARIA attributes are only allowed on an element under certain conditions. Learn more about conditional ARIA attributes

Deprecated ARIA roles were not used
Deprecated ARIA roles may not be processed correctly by assistive technology. Learn more about deprecated ARIA roles

[aria-hidden="true"] is not present on the document <body>
Assistive technologies, like screen readers, work inconsistently when aria-hidden="true" is set on the document <body>. Learn how
aria-hidden
affects the document body

[aria-hidden="true"] elements do not contain focusable descendents
Focusable descendents within an [aria-hidden="true"] element prevent those interactive elements from being available to users of assistive technologies like screen readers. Learn how
aria-hidden
affects focusable elements

Elements use only permitted ARIA attributes
Using ARIA attributes in roles where they are prohibited can mean that important information is not communicated to users of assistive technologies. Learn more about prohibited ARIA roles

[role]s have all required [aria-*] attributes
Some ARIA roles have required attributes that describe the state of the element to screen readers. Learn more about roles and required attributes

[role] values are valid
ARIA roles must have valid values in order to perform their intended accessibility functions. Learn more about valid ARIA roles

[aria-*] attributes have valid values
Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid values. Learn more about valid values for ARIA attributes

[aria-*] attributes are valid and not misspelled
Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid names. Learn more about valid ARIA attributes

Buttons have an accessible name
When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. Learn how to make buttons more accessible

Document has a <title> element
The title gives screen reader users an overview of the page, and search engine users rely on it heavily to determine if a page is relevant to their search. Learn more about document titles

Heading elements appear in a sequentially-descending order
Properly ordered headings that do not skip levels convey the semantic structure of the page, making it easier to navigate and understand when using assistive technologies. Learn more about heading order

<html> element has a [lang] attribute
If a page doesn't specify a lang attribute, a screen reader assumes that the page is in the default language that the user chose when setting up the screen reader. If the page isn't actually in the default language, then the screen reader might not announce the page's text correctly. Learn more about the
lang
attribute

<html> element has a valid value for its [lang] attribute
Specifying a valid BCP 47 language helps screen readers announce text properly. Learn how to use the
lang
attribute

Image elements have [alt] attributes
Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternate text. Decorative elements can be ignored with an empty alt attribute. Learn more about the
alt
attribute

Image elements do not have [alt] attributes that are redundant text.
Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternative text. Alternative text that is exactly the same as the text adjacent to the link or image is potentially confusing for screen reader users, because the text will be read twice. Learn more about the
alt
attribute

Links have a discernible name
Link text (and alternate text for images, when used as links) that is discernible, unique, and focusable improves the navigation experience for screen reader users. Learn how to make links accessible

[user-scalable="no"] is not used in the <meta name="viewport"> element and the [maximum-scale] attribute is not less than 5.
Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. Learn more about the viewport meta tag

Touch targets have sufficient size and spacing.
Touch targets with sufficient size and spacing help users who may have difficulty targeting small controls to activate the targets. Learn more about touch targets

Best Practices
Standards that your site should follow

Displays images with incorrect aspect ratio
Image display dimensions should match natural aspect ratio. Learn more about image aspect ratio

Missing source maps for large first-party JavaScript
Source maps translate minified code to the original source code. This helps developers debug in production. In addition, Lighthouse is able to provide further insights. Consider deploying source maps to take advantage of these benefits. Learn more about source maps

Uses HTTPS
All sites should be protected with HTTPS, even ones that don't handle sensitive data. This includes avoiding mixed content, where some resources are loaded over HTTP despite the initial request being served over HTTPS. HTTPS prevents intruders from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications between your app and your users, and is a prerequisite for HTTP/2 and many new web platform APIs. Learn more about HTTPS

Avoids requesting the geolocation permission on page load
Users are mistrustful of or confused by sites that request their location without context. Consider tying the request to a user action instead. Learn more about the geolocation permission

Avoids requesting the notification permission on page load
Users are mistrustful of or confused by sites that request to send notifications without context. Consider tying the request to user gestures instead. Learn more about responsibly getting permission for notifications

Allows users to paste into input fields
Preventing input pasting is a bad practice for the UX, and weakens security by blocking password managers.Learn more about user-friendly input fields

Serves images with appropriate resolution
Image natural dimensions should be proportional to the display size and the pixel ratio to maximize image clarity. Learn how to provide responsive images

Has a <meta name="viewport"> tag with width or initial-scale
A <meta name="viewport"> not only optimizes your app for mobile screen sizes, but also prevents a 300 millisecond delay to user input. Learn more about using the viewport meta tag

Document uses legible font sizes
Font sizes less than 12px are too small to be legible and require mobile visitors to “pinch to zoom” in order to read. Strive to have >60% of page text ≥12px. Learn more about legible font sizes

Page has the HTML doctype
Specifying a doctype prevents the browser from switching to quirks-mode. Learn more about the doctype declaration

Properly defines charset
A character encoding declaration is required. It can be done with a <meta> tag in the first 1024 bytes of the HTML or in the Content-Type HTTP response header. Learn more about declaring the character encoding

Avoids deprecated APIs
Deprecated APIs will eventually be removed from the browser. Learn more about deprecated APIs

Avoids third-party cookies
Third-party cookies may be blocked in some contexts. Learn more about preparing for third-party cookie restrictions

No browser errors logged to the console
Errors logged to the console indicate unresolved problems. They can come from network request failures and other browser concerns. Learn more about this errors in console diagnostic audit

No issues in the Issues panel in Chrome Devtools
Issues logged to the Issues panel in Chrome Devtools indicate unresolved problems. They can come from network request failures, insufficient security controls, and other browser concerns. Open up the Issues panel in Chrome DevTools for more details on each issue
